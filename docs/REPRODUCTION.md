# Reproduce the study

Use Python 3.12 and install the root requirements.txt. Download the checksum-verified Online Resource 1 with `python get_artifacts.py`. A local copy can be installed with `python get_artifacts.py --archive PATH_TO_ZIP`. Existing files are retained when their bytes match; conflicting files stop extraction for review.

## Acquisition from saved probabilities

Boundary tables do not require labels or a dataset. Run `python boundary_demo.py --pool-size 240` to construct the declared rank bounds and independently recompute their joint crossing probability. The functions are `calibrated_brackets` (boundary-table construction) and `crossing_probability` (joint absorbing recursion) in `revision6/horizon.py`. The sequence and stopping implementation is `revision6/sequential.py`.

The artifact installer preserves newer figure/documentation files in the checkout. Frozen numerical files and the locked implementation still must match the release; it stops on conflicting numerical evidence rather than overwriting it.

- `python reproduce.py --smoke`: one complete case, compared with frozen rows.
- `python reproduce.py`: all 354 cases and the aggregate tables.
- `python revision6/reproduce.py --resume --output PATH`: resume a timestamped output directory.
- `python revision7/prior_audit.py --full`: reconstruct the subsequent four-prior diagnostic.
- `python visualization/rebuild_figures.py`: reconstruct quantitative figures; the editable architecture is supplied under figures/.

Reproductions create timestamped output directories and preserve the locked reference results. These commands do not fit new classifiers and do not establish an independent confirmation experiment.

## Refitting

Additional classifier dependencies are in revision6/requirements.txt. Training and preprocessing scripts are provided under revision/, revision5/ and revision6/. Obtain the original signals from their providers as described in docs/DATA.md. Raw USC-HAD signals are not redistributed. The supplied original classifier implementation used an RTX 4070 Laptop GPU and the pinned CUDA-enabled training environment; CPU timing is not comparable. Use a separate working copy for refits, because training scripts cache completed cases.

## Additional HHAR confirmation

`python confirmation_hhar/reproduce.py --smoke` checks one additional case; omit `--smoke` for all45. Protocol and implementation: confirmation_hhar/protocol.json, prepare.py, train.py, evaluate.py and analyze.py. Table9 and its paired intervals come from confirmation_hhar/summaries/.
